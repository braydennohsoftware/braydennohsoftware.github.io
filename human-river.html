<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Throughout history, meandering rivers have acted as <b>spatial attractors</b> for human civilization. Rivers provide food and transportation, minimizing the thermodynamic work required for resource extraction and navigation. Cities like Cairo, London, and Kolkata all grew around river bends.
</p>

<p>
But rivers are also destroyers. Through a process called <b>avulsion</b>, a river can suddenly shift course and wipe out settlements in its path. In this sense, a river functions as an unpredictable attractor &mdash; one that can create and destroy, analogous to a black hole.
</p>

<p>
<b>Human-River</b> is a computational model that couples these two forces &mdash; the pull of the river and the resilience of human settlements &mdash; into a single dynamical system. It is the first model of its kind to treat human and geomorphic evolution as a <i>coupled</i> process.
</p>


<h2 id="the-problem">2. The Problem</h2>

<p>
Human settlements near rivers are shaped by three competing forces:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>River attraction.</b> Settlements want to be close to the river for resources and transportation.</li>
  <li><b>Economies of scale.</b> Settlements want to cluster together to share public goods and reduce transaction costs (the <i>bid-rent model</i> from urban economics).</li>
  <li><b>Spatial inertia.</b> A settlement will not abandon existing functional infrastructure the moment a marginally better location appears. Relocation only happens when the environmental stress gradient exceeds a critical resistance threshold.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The question is: what happens when you let these three rules play out on a grid while a river meanders through it? What stable patterns emerge? When do settlements jump across the river, go extinct, or sprawl outward?
</p>


<h2 id="setting-up">3. Setting Up the Model</h2>

<h3 id="the-lattice">3.1 The Lattice</h3>

<p>
The model runs on a two-dimensional grid (lattice). Each cell on the grid is one of three things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>River cell</b> &mdash; <code>R(x, t) = 1</code></li>
  <li><b>Settlement cell</b> &mdash; <code>V(x, t) = 1</code> on a floodplain cell</li>
  <li><b>Empty floodplain</b> &mdash; <code>R = 0</code> and <code>V = 0</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
One key rule: a settlement cell can <i>never</i> occupy the same cell as a river cell. If the river moves into a settlement, that settlement is destroyed.
</p>

<h3 id="conservation">3.2 Conservation Laws</h3>

<p>
The model assumes population is conserved &mdash; the total number of settlement cells <code>N</code> stays constant over time. If a settlement is destroyed by the river, an equivalent settlement must appear elsewhere on the floodplain. Think of it as displaced people relocating rather than disappearing.
</p>

<h3 id="utility">3.3 The Utility Field</h3>

<p>
Each floodplain cell has a <b>utility score</b> that determines how attractive it is for settlement. The utility is defined as:
</p>

<pre><code>U(x, t) = -w_d * D(x, t) + w_c * C(x, t)</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>D(x, t)</code> is the <b>distance to the nearest river cell</b> &mdash; farther from the river means lower utility (less access to resources).</li>
  <li><code>C(x, t)</code> is the <b>local clustering score</b> &mdash; how many of the 8 neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood) are also settlements. More neighbors means higher utility (economies of scale).</li>
  <li><code>w_d</code> and <code>w_c</code> are tunable coupling constants that control the relative strength of each force.</li>
</ul>

<p>
River cells themselves have a utility of negative infinity &mdash; settlements can never occupy them.
</p>


<h2 id="dynamics">4. How the Simulation Runs</h2>

<h3 id="geomorphic-migration">4.1 Geomorphic Migration</h3>

<p>
As the river meanders across the grid, it can invade floodplain cells that contain settlements. When this happens:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The settlement cell is <b>destroyed</b> (set to 0).</li>
  <li>To conserve mass, a new settlement cell is placed at the <b>empty floodplain cell with the highest utility</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This models the real-world process of communities being displaced by flooding and relocating to the next best available location.
</p>

<h3 id="gradient-migration">4.2 Gradient-Driven Migration</h3>

<p>
Even when the river isn't destroying anything, settlements continuously try to improve their position. At each timestep, the model:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Finds the <b>least happy</b> settlement cell (lowest utility).</li>
  <li>Finds the <b>best available</b> empty floodplain cell (highest utility).</li>
  <li>Swaps them &mdash; <i>but only if</i> the utility gain exceeds a friction threshold <code>&mu;</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The friction parameter <code>&mu;</code> represents <b>spatial inertia</b> &mdash; the sunk costs of abandoning existing infrastructure. A high <code>&mu;</code> means settlements are stubborn and won't move unless conditions are dramatically better elsewhere. A low <code>&mu;</code> means settlements are highly mobile.
</p>

<p>
The system keeps swapping until no further beneficial moves exist, reaching a stable configuration for that timestep. Then the river advances and the process repeats.
</p>


<h2 id="what-emerges">5. What Emerges</h2>

<p>
By varying the parameters (<code>w_d</code>, <code>w_c</code>, <code>&mu;</code>) and the dynamics (linear vs. non-linear, deterministic vs. stochastic, causally directed vs. coupled), the model explores:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Stable regimes</b> &mdash; settlements that reach a steady-state configuration relative to the river.</li>
  <li><b>Transient regimes</b> &mdash; settlements in constant flux, never reaching equilibrium.</li>
  <li><b>Threshold behavior</b> &mdash; sudden phase transitions such as settlements jumping across the river, urban sprawl, or settlement extinction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The model investigates which properties remain <i>invariant</i> across different dynamic regimes &mdash; and which ones break down.
</p>


<h2 id="applications">6. Applications</h2>

<p>
This model has implications for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Urban planning</b> &mdash; understanding how cities naturally organize around shifting waterways.</li>
  <li><b>Disaster risk mitigation</b> &mdash; predicting which settlements are most vulnerable to river migration.</li>
  <li><b>Theoretical bounds on forecasting</b> &mdash; setting upper limits on how accurately we can predict coupled human-geomorphic systems.</li>
</ul>
