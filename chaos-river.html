<h1>Cutoffs Create Chaos in Meandering River</h1>

<p>
Rivers meander. As bends grow, they occasionally loop back on themselves and short-circuit &mdash; an event called a <b>cutoff</b>. We asked a simple question: are cutoffs enough to make river evolution chaotic?
</p>

<p>
To test this, we ran pairs of simulations using <i>meanderpy</i>, a kinematic meander model where lateral migration is driven by curvature. Each pair starts from nearly identical initial conditions &mdash; differing by a single node displaced by a tiny amount &mdash; and is integrated forward for 10,000 years.
</p>

<p>
The challenge is that the river centerline changes length over time (nodes are added as bends grow and removed at cutoffs), so we can't directly compare two Lagrangian state vectors. Instead, we map each centerline onto a fixed Eulerian grid of binary cells &mdash; channel (1) or floodplain (0) &mdash; which gives us a fixed-dimensional state for comparison.

We measure divergence between two runs using the Hamming distance \(d_H(t) = \|\mathbf{S}^*(t) - \mathbf{S}(t)\|_1\), which counts the number of grid cells that differ. If this grows exponentially, the system is chaotic. The rate of growth is the finite-time Lyapunov exponent:
</p>

\[\lambda_{\text{FT}} = (t_2 - t_1)^{-1} \ln\!\left[\frac{d_H(t_2)}{d_H(t_1)}\right]\]

<p>
The result is clean. With cutoffs disabled, the two trajectories remain identical &mdash; \(d_H(t) = 0\) for the entire run. With cutoffs enabled, they diverge exponentially. The video below shows this divergence in action:

<p>
The Lyapunov exponent converges with grid refinement, is insensitive to perturbation magnitude, and is consistent across different initial planforms. It scales with migration rate but is invariant to the cutoff threshold. In short: cutoffs alone are sufficient for chaos, and they impose a finite predictability horizon on river planform evolution.
